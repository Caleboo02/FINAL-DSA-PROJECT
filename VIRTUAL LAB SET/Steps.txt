Virtual Cybersecurity Lab Setup
===============================

Objective:
----------
To simulate a secure, real-world environment for offensive and defensive testing using Kali Linux and Windows 10 virtual machines.

Tools Used:
-----------
- VirtualBox (Type 2 hypervisor)
- Kali Linux ISO
- Windows 10 ISO 

Steps:
------

1. **Installed VirtualBox** on host system (Windows/Linux)

2. **Created and configured Kali VM:**
   - OS: Kali Linux (latest)
   - RAM: 2 GB
   - Storage: 20 GB dynamically allocated
   - Network: Internal Network (named "LabNet")

3. **Created and configured Windows 10 VM:**
   - OS: Windows 10 Pro or Home
   - RAM: 2 GB
   - Storage: 20 GB dynamically allocated
   - Network: Internal Network (same name as Kali)

4. **Verified network isolation:**
   - No internet access
   - Both VMs connected only to each other

5. **Set static IPs:**
   - Kali: 192.168.10.2
   - Windows: 192.168.10.3
   - Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0

6. **Ping Test:**
   - Successfully pinged Windows from Kali
   - Successfully pinged Kali from Windows

7. **Tested Shared Folder Access:**
   - Enabled guest additions on Kali
   - Created shared folder to exchange files (optional)

8. **Service Enumeration (Optional):**
   - From Kali, used `nmap 192.168.10.3` to scan Windows open ports

Result:
--------
A fully isolated and connected cybersecurity test lab ready for penetration testing and malware simulation.
