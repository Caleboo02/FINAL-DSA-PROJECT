Virtual Firewall Lab – pfSense Setup and Testing


Objective:
-----------
To simulate a secure virtual firewall setup using pfSense to route and inspect network traffic between Kali Linux (attacker) and Windows 10 (target).

Tools Used:
------------
- VirtualBox
- pfSense ISO
- Kali Linux VM
- Windows 10 VM
- Firefox

Steps Taken:
-------------

1. **Created a new pfSense VM in VirtualBox**
   - Added two network adapters:
     • Adapter 1 (WAN): Attached to NAT
     • Adapter 2 (LAN): Attached to Internal Network (named "LabNet")

2. **Installed pfSense using default options**
   - Set LAN IP: `192.168.100.1/24`
   - Skipped WAN setup in the browser interface

3. **Accessed pfSense GUI from Kali**
   - Assigned Kali IP: `192.168.100.10`
   - Opened browser and visited `https://192.168.100.1`

4. **Enabled DHCP on pfSense LAN interface**
   - Range: `192.168.100.50 – 192.168.100.100`

5. **Connected Windows 10 VM to the same Internal Network**
   - Received IP via DHCP: `192.168.100.53`

6. **Created a firewall rule in pfSense**
   - Allowed ICMP protocol to enable ping between machines

7. **Tested communication**
   - Kali pinged Windows and pfSense successfully
   - Windows pinged pfSense and Kali successfully

8. **Monitored logs**
   - Went to `Status > System Logs > Firewall`
   - Verified that ping (ICMP) traffic was being logged

Result:
--------
The pfSense firewall successfully controlled and monitored traffic between Kali and Windows, simulating a real-world network security layer.
