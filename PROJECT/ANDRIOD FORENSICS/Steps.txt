Android Forensics Project – Autopsy Analysis
============================================

Objective:
-----------
To investigate a provided Android image for digital evidence including SMS, call logs, contacts, app usage, browser history, files, and deleted content.

Tools Used:
------------
- Autopsy (Forensic Suite)
- Android forensic image (.tar.gz and data)
Methodology:
-------------
The investigation followed standard digital forensics procedures to ensure the integrity and admissibility of evidence:

1. **Preservation**
   - The original Android forensic image (`.tar.gz`) was preserved in its raw form.
   - Extraction was done without altering timestamps or metadata.

2. **Examination**
   - The image was ingested into Autopsy using appropriate ingest modules.
   - Targeted searches were conducted for SMS, call logs, contacts, app usage, browser history, and deleted data.

3. **Analysis**
   - SQLite databases (e.g., contacts2.db, mmssms.db) were parsed by Autopsy’s Android Analyzer.
   - Image and document files were manually reviewed.
   - Deleted files were located using file carving and Autopsy recovery modules.

4. **Documentation**
   - Screenshots were taken at each critical point to document findings.
   - Notes were maintained regarding timestamps, user activity, and app behavior.

5. **Reporting**
   - A structured report was compiled including tools, methodology, findings, and professional recommendations.

Steps Taken:
-------------

1. **Extracted the forensic image:**
   - File provided: `android_data.tar.gz`
   - Extracted using:
     ```
     tar -xvzf android_data.tar.gz
     ```

2. **Opened Autopsy and created a new case:**
   - Case name: DSA CASE
   - Examiner: Adenika Caleb Ayoola
   - Case type: Local Disk Image

3. **Ingested the extracted image:**
   - Pointed Autopsy to the `.img` or extracted folder
   - Enabled ingest modules: 
     - Keyword Search
     - Extract Files
     - Android Analyzer
     - Web History Analyzer

4. **Evidence Extraction:**
   - **SMS & Call Logs:** Located using Android Analyzer module
   - **Contacts:** Found in `contacts2.db`
   - **Browser History:** Retrieved from Chrome and default browser SQLite DBs
   - **App Usage:** Identified popular apps and recent activity
   - **Media Files:** Images, videos, downloads were extracted
   - **Deleted Files:** Recovered through Autopsy file recovery module

5. **Screenshots Taken:**
   - Autopsy dashboard
   - Extracted SMS, call logs, contacts
   - File analysis panel (images, deleted files)
   - Browser history view

6. **Report Drafted:**
   - Findings summarized
   - Screenshots included
  

Conclusion:
------------
The Android image analysis successfully uncovered mock data from apps, system logs, and user behavior. The report provides insight into digital forensics methodology and tool usage.

Recommendations:
----------------
- Secure all forensic image files in read-only mode to prevent accidental modification.
- Use mobile-specific tools (e.g., Magnet AXIOM, Cellebrite) for deeper extraction of encrypted content and third-party apps.
- Maintain proper documentation and evidence handling to ensure legal admissibility.
